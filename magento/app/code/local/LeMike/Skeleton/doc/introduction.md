<aside class="notes">
    The developer can test his algorithms in the blackbox which means that he looks what happens inside the code
    if some prequesites change.
    In addition to that the whitebox test only validates the user-input and method-output to serve several common
    usages.
    At last the limiting conditions have to be tested and the correct behaviour on bypassing these limits have to be
    assured.

UnitTests are isolated - they do not interferre.

Design-by-Contract is optional for faster development process.

PHPUnit gives the opportunity for semi-automated tests to assure the **already tested** functionality.
<aside class="notes">
    Because only tested componenty and use cases can be validated.
    A test is never complete and just ensures that new code didn't harm the old one.
    Never the less automated testing brings a great effort to check this at any time very fast.
