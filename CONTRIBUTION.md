## Contribute

Fork and add your own snippets.
Make a branch for you like `branch-johnDoe` and put in anything you like.
We will put it at the right place and merge.

There are some easy rules:

 - Every new sentence is in a new line and lines are only 80 characters long.
 - We do the structure and it will be capped to 5 (snippets in a category, subcategory per category,
   categories per file, files per folder, folder in a folder etc.)
